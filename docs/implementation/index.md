# Network Implementation

The goal of this project is to install a pilot grid network of KapitWifi access points connected to a centralized router. This network spans a 1km^2 area. This area should be located around the ELEISS Office in Barangay Nazareth, from which the main router will be located. The access points should be laid out in a grid-like pattern, with distances of 200m from each neighboring access point (excluding adjacent points).
The LAN connections will span from the central router and out to each cardinal and intermediate direction, forming a web-like network connection with a grid-like placement of access points.
